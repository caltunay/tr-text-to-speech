there are no speech therapy apps in turkish. this is a quickly spun up, simple streamlit app for turkish speaking stroke victims that are struggling with speaking, writing and understanding (usually due to problems around the bit that controls speaking in the brain)totally copyleft, use it from the link above, take it, adapt it, improve it.

app only has a free text form that takes input and a calls a text-to-speech api for users that need a voice on top of writing/typing.

todo: needs suggestions, corrections, autocomplete etc.
